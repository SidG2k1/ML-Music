# ML Music

This is a high school Grade 11 project where I use stochastic beam search (independently discovered), to find appealing chord progressions.

Note, a lot of the terminology, while incorrect, maps to standard AI terminology since I built the code with a intuitive understanding of genetics from biological perspective rather than a software engineering perspective.
